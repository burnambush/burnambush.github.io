          <figcaption> My research focuses on developing intelligent systems that tightly integrate decision making with machine learning and probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty. I have made core contributions across multiple scientific domains, ranging from artificial intelligence, machine learning, renewable energy, materials science, crowdsourcing, citizen science, urban computing, ecology, to behavioral econometrics. In my research, I focus on developing cross-cutting computational methods with applications to a variety of domains, with an emphasis in the new exciting area of computational sustainability and scientific discovery. Prior to coming to Purdue, I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, working with Professor Carla Gomes and Professor Bart Selman. I received a B.Sc. in 2011 from School of EECS, Peking University, China.
